## Project Description: JavaScript To-Do List App

**This project aims to develop a functional and user-friendly to-do list application using JavaScript.**

The app will allow users to:

* **Add tasks:** Users can input tasks they need to complete.
* **Mark tasks as completed:** Users can indicate when tasks have been finished.
* **Remove tasks:** Users can delete tasks that are no longer relevant.
* **Edit tasks:** Users can modify the content or priority of existing tasks.

Key features and functionalities will include:

* **Local storage:** Tasks will be stored locally using JavaScript's localStorage API for persistence.
* **Task prioritization:** Users can assign different levels of importance to tasks.
* **Task filtering:** Users can filter tasks based on their completion status or priority.
* **User-friendly interface:** The app will have a clean and intuitive design.

By building this to-do list app, I will demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage.
 
**Would you like to add more details about your to-do list app, such as specific features or technologies you plan to use?**
